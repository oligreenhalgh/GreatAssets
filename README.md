## 💡 Inspiration
The UK investment landscape is currently bifurcated: high-net-worth individuals have access to bespoke wealth management, while the average young professional is left with basic index funds or high-risk "meme stocks." 

**Great Assets** was born from a simple question: *How can we use Open Banking and AI to give everyone the "Great Assets" typically reserved for the top 1%?*

---

## ✨ What it Does
Great Assets is an AI-augmented wealth platform that bridges the gap between retail banking and institutional-grade investing.

* **⚡ Instant Asset Tokenization:** Provides access to fractional shares of UK-based green infrastructure and commercial real estate.
* **🤖 AI Portfolio Architect:** Uses NLP to analyze your spending habits via Open Banking and suggests a personalized risk-adjusted portfolio.
* **🌍 ESG Transparency:** Every asset is vetted through our "Greatness Score," calculating real-world impact alongside ROI.
* **💂 UK Tax-Optimised:** Automatic ISA and GIA allocation logic to maximize tax efficiency under current HMRC guidelines.

---

## 🧠 The Technical Core
We developed a proprietary algorithm to determine the **Asset Health Index (AHI)**. The score is calculated as:

$$AHI = \frac{\sum (Risk_{i} \times Weight_{i})}{\sigma_{portfolio}} + \Delta ESG$$

*Where $\Delta ESG$ represents the real-time sustainability delta sourced from carbon-offset APIs.*
